🥳EnjoySport Prediction using Machine Learning🥳
This project implements a machine learning algorithm to predict whether an individual enjoys a sport based on various features. It serves as an example of applying basic machine learning concepts to a well-known problem in the field of artificial intelligence.
🧑‍🏫Project Overview
🥅Goal: Predict if a person enjoys a particular sport based on input attributes like weather, temperature, and other relevant features.
Algorithm: The project uses a simple learning algorithm, often a version of the Find-S algorithm, as it is traditionally used to demonstrate the EnjoySport problem in concept learning.
